<h1>The Best Movies According To Justin Fanton</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
 <p>Not only is this movie choc full of easter eggs and comic accurate references, but the suit designs are superb and the humour is right up my alley.</p>
 <h3>Star Wars Episode 3:Revenge of the Sith</h3>
 <p>I cannot stress enough how amazing the lightsaber battles were in this movie, the choreography must have taken weeks to nail down. The fight between Anakin and Obi Wan will always send shivers down my spine.</p>
 <h3>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
 <p>Everyone has that one scene in a movie where they honestly just can't sit still due to too much excitement. This movie is not only overflowing with those kind of moments, but the battle of Helm's Deep was one of the most revolutionary film scenes to ever hit the circuit. I will never forget watching Legolas surf down a stairway on a sheild sniping random Urukai with his trusty bow and elf eyes.</p>
